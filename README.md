# Young_People_Survey

In 2013, students of the Statistics class at FSEV UK were asked to invite their friends to participate in this survey.

* The data file (responses.csv) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139 integer and 11 categorical).
* For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the data file. See the columns.csv file if you want to match the data with the original names.
* The data contain missing values.
* The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.
* The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated into English.
* All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.

The variables can be split into the following groups:
